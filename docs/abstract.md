ReasonSynth is a lightweight symbolic synthesis system that translates natural-language function specifications into small, verifiable Python programs. Instead of relying solely on probabilistic neural generation, ReasonSynth uses grammar-based parsing to extract preconditions and postconditions, synthesizes straightforward implementations, and then employs the Z3 SMT solver to formally verify that the implementation satisfies the declared specification. This pipeline—Natural Language → Formal Spec → Synthesized Code → Theorem Prover—produces deterministic outputs with proof certificates that can be audited or used in downstream safety-critical workflows.

The system targets use cases where correctness is essential: verification of library routines, contract enforcement in service code, and educational demonstrations of formal methods. ReasonSynth demonstrates that many common specification patterns (e.g., arithmetic transformations, parity checks) can be captured by compact grammars and proven automatically. While intentionally minimal, the prototype shows a practical integration path for augmenting neural code assistants with symbolic validation layers: an LLM can propose candidates while ReasonSynth certifies or rejects them, improving trust and reducing silent failures. Future work includes expanding the grammar and spec language, richer expression synthesis, and hybrid symbolic–neural strategies to scale to more complex program classes.
