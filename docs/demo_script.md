# 🎥 ReasonSynth Demo Script — (3 Minutes)

1. **Introduction**
   > “Welcome to ReasonSynth — where intent becomes provable code.”

2. **Step 1: Input a task**
   - Type: *Write a function that returns the square of a number greater than 0.*

3. **Step 2: Explain synthesis**
   - The system extracts precondition `x > 0`
   - Synthesizes code and proves logical correctness

4. **Step 3: Display**
   - Show the verified code and “✅ Proven” message

5. **Step 4: Try a wrong spec**
   - Type: *Write a function that returns the cube but asserts result == x**2*
   - See the system respond: ❌ Verification failed — contradiction found.

6. **Step 5: Conclude**
   > “Every program ReasonSynth writes comes with a formal proof — deterministic, explainable, and correct by construction.”
